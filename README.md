# Terynum - A very simple Hi Lo game using .Net Maui

# Notes: 
	The game was developed with database management in mind, so the models where built with that in mind to be almost ready for it.
	Folder [Models] has all the models used.
	Folder [Services] has the main service used, that has all the match management.
	MVVM arquitecture was used, so the pages with layout are in the folder [Pages] and their view models in [ViewModels]

# TODO: 
	1 - add database management
	2 - allow see results and ranking
	3 - improve code with dependency injection
	4 - maybe build all data access in a microservices arquitecture
